**Title:** 
Smart Speed Monitoring System

**Description:**
This project implements a real-time vehicle speed monitoring system using a Raspberry Pi and machine learning. It leverages EfficientDet, a pre-trained model, to detect, track, and calculate the speed of vehicles within a designated area. 

**Features:**

* **Vehicle Detection and Tracking:** EfficientDet accurately detects and tracks vehicles in the video feed captured by the Raspberry Pi camera.
* **Speed Calculation:** Based on the tracked vehicles, their speeds are calculated and compared to a predefined speed limit (default: 40km/hr).
* **Over-Speeding Detection:** Vehicles exceeding the speed limit trigger the system to capture details, including speed, timestamp, and color.
* **Data Transmission:** Information about exceeding vehicles (speed, timestamp, color, and an image) is transmitted via a Wi-Fi module on the Raspberry Pi to a database.
* **Front-End Integration:** The database data becomes accessible through a provided front-end website for visualization and potential further actions.

**Hardware Setup:**

1. **Raspberry Pi:**
    * Acquire a Raspberry Pi (model 4 or later recommended for performance).
    * Connect a camera module compatible with your Raspberry Pi model.
2. **Power Supply:**
    * Employ a solar panel to provide a sustainable power source.
    * Utilize a charge controller to regulate the incoming solar power.
    * Connect a battery to store excess solar energy and ensure uninterrupted operation.
    * Implement a buck converter to step down the battery voltage to match the Raspberry Pi's specific voltage requirements.
3. **Wi-Fi Module:**
    * Ensure a Wi-Fi connection for data transmission.

2. **Software Setup:**
    * Install the Raspberry Pi OS (refer to official documentation).
    * Install Python (version 3.6 or later) on the Raspberry Pi.
    * Follow the installation instructions for the specific EfficientDet model and libraries used (refer to the chosen EfficientDet implementation and libraries' documentation).
    * Set up a database to store collected data
    * Develop the front-end website to consume data from the database (your specific web development framework's setup instructions apply).
3. **Configuration:**
    * Replace the placeholder values in the code with your Wi-Fi credentials, database connection details, and front-end base URL (currently set to Raspberry Pi's IP address).
    * Adjust the speed limit threshold as needed.

**Usage:**

1. **Run the Python Script:**
    * Navigate to the project directory on your Raspberry Pi.
    * Execute the main Python script using a command like `python main.py` (replace `main.py` with the actual script name).
2. **Access Front-End Website:**
    * Open the provided front-end website in your web browser, ensuring it's accessible from the same network as your Raspberry Pi.
    * You should be able to view information about vehicles exceeding the speed limit.

**Dependencies:**

* Python (version 3.6 or later)
* EfficientDet lite-0 metadata

**Front-End Technology Stack:**
React.js, Axios

**Power Supply:** While this project utilizes a solar panel setup, alternative power sources (e.g., AC adapter) can be used if solar power is not feasible. Ensure proper power management for continuous operation.
